## My process

### Built with

-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Bundler
-   [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Styling solution
-   TypeScript

### What I learned

Got better at using tailwind and configuring it, it's starting to feel like home. The Filter bar was probably the hardest thing to get right, but besides that it was mostly fun.
